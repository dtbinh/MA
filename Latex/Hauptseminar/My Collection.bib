abstract = {We analyze the effects of communication delays in teleoperation systems using dissipativity theory along with explicit models of the operator and robot. We utilize a simple model of the operator's behavior that describes human pointing motions, as generated by an interface such as a mouse pointer or tablet, and we use a robot model that is suitable for mobile robots or robotic manipulators. Using dissipativity conditions for stability, we show that the communication delays can be compensated for in the robot controller with a relatively simple extension to a controller designed for the situation without delays. We also show that the communication delays can lead to problems for human pointing in certain situations; specifically, if the operator overshoots their target, it may lead to instability unless corrective action is taken by the user interface. Simulation is shown to validate the results. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 IFAC.},
